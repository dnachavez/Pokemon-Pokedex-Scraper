## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

t is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: To have an automated, reliable, and efficient method to extract and store Pok√©mon Pok√©dex data for analysis and usage in various applications.
- REALITY: Currently, there is no easy way to get this data programmatically from the website in a structured format like CSV or a database.
- CONSEQUENCES: Without an automated solution, collecting and using the data becomes time-consuming and error-prone, limiting its potential applications in data analysis, machine learning, and other areas.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This project provides a Python script that scrapes the complete [Pok√©mon Pok√©dex](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all) list from the Pok√©mon Database website, cleans the data, and stores it in both CSV and SQLite database formats.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Dependencies:
  - Python 3.7+
  - requests library for making HTTP requests.
  - beautifulsoup4 for parsing HTML content.
  - pandas for data manipulation and storage.
  - tqdm for displaying a progress bar.
  - sqlite3 for database operations (part of Python Standard Library).

- Limitations:
  - The script relies on the structure of the HTML page. Any changes to the HTML structure of the source website may break the script.
  - Internet connection is required to fetch the data from the website.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Automate the script to run at regular intervals and update the database with new Pok√©mon data.
- Extend the script to include additional data points such as abilities, evolutions, and moves.
- Develop a web interface to display and query the Pok√©mon data stored in the database.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.7+ installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-pokedex-scraper.git
cd pokemon-pokedex-scraper
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas tqdm
```

3. **Run the script:**
```
python app.ipynb
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After running the script, you will find two files in the project directory:

- pokedex.csv: Contains the complete Pok√©mon Pok√©dex data in CSV format.
- pokedex.db: Contains the same data stored in a SQLite database.
